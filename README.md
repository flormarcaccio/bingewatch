#### Background
With the current advancements of so many online streaming websites for movies, one can now watch any movie old and new. However, with such a sheer volume of movies, it becomes overwhelming to browse among them and find a movie of one’s choice and taste. We intend to build a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system that provides recommendations based on similar profiles of its users. The goal is to provide a personalized streaming experience based on the user’s preference and liking. 

One key advantage of collaborative filtering is that it is independent of product knowledge. Rather, it relies on the users with a basic assumption that what the users liked in the past will also be liked in the future. For example, if a person A watches crime, sci-fi, and thriller genres and B watches sci-fi, thriller, and action genres then A will also like action, and B will like crime genre.
