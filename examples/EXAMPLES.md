This file demonstrates how users can interact with our movie recommendation visualization tool.

## Accessing the tool

The visualization tool is hosted on Heroku, a cloud platform which allows applications to be accessed through a web browser.

Users can access our tool by simply clicking the following link: (link here).

## Getting started

Our interface consists of two tabs: the first displays the choice-based recommendation, while the second tab shows the genre/time-based recommendation. 

(picture of tab 1 here) (picture of tab 2 here)

In the first use case, if a user is interested in a movie similar to another movie they already watched, they can type in or select a liked movie and receive a list of top 10 movies similarly liked by others. This functionality is available through the first tab of our visualization.

In the second use case, if a user wants to see the top 10 movies or shows of a particular year, they can use the slider to select their desired year, and a list of the top 10 recommendations will be displayed. This functionality is available through the second tab of our visualization.

In the third use case, if a user wants to see the top 10 movies or shows of a particular genre, they can select their desired genre from a dropdown, and a list of the top 10 recommendations will be displayed. This functionality is available through the second tab of our visualization.

The second tab also allows users to select combinations of years and genres, as well as whether the user is interested in movies or TV shows.

### Filter options

Within the second tab, users can filter on whether they want to view movies or TV shows, which genres they are interested in, and which year the movie or show should be from.
